## ðŸ“² Why this repository ? 

I have created this project in order to **share** with you yet another possible architecture of an android application. One of my interpretation.
The purpose is not to publish this app but to share my work. I would love to discuss why I did that, or choose this, debate with you and find better solutions so we can grow together :) 

## What is it ?

It is a simple android application. 
It contains 2 features : 
- login
- diagnosis

The diagnosis allows you to test the touchable part of your entire screen. 

Feel free to give it a try if you want ;)

## ðŸ”§ How ?

With my experiences in the android ecosystem ^^. 
For more details :
- I tried to respect a maximum of the [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles (as uncle bob sees it).
- I tried to have a maxium of classes that has one Single Responsability.
- I have modularized the project in feature (both product feature & tech feature) because I'm convinced modularization has so many advantages that helps us write fine and understable code. I was inspired by the Googlers that wrotes the open source [Plaid android app](https://github.com/android/plaid).

## ðŸ¦» Feedback

Feel free to contribute, comment, give me your feedback on my work. 
I would love to discuss architecture choices, debate tech decisions with you !
