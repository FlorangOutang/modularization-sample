## ðŸ“² Why this repository ? 

I have created this project in a **test purpose**. 

What do I mean by test : I want to share yet another possible architecture of an android application. One of my interpretation. 

## ðŸ”§ How ?

With my experiences in the android ecosystem ^^. 
For more details :
- I tried to respect a maximum of the [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles (as uncle bob sees it).
- I tried to have a maxium of classes that has one Single Responsability
- I have modularized the project in feature (both product feature & tech feature). I was inspired by the Googler that wrotes the open source [Plaid android app](https://github.com/android/plaid)

## ðŸ¦» Feedback

I would love to discuss architecture choices, debate tech decisions with you !
